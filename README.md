# Character-based Chatbot App using PALM2

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
To use this chatbot project, you'll need Node.js and npm on your machine.

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine. Navigate into the project folder.

Run npm install to get all required dependencies.

Start the development server with npm start. The app will now be available at localhost:3000.

### Use Case
In the chatbot, first, you'll need to enter the name of the character you want it to act like. This will fetch that character's bio and example dialogues.

You can now have a conversation with the chatbot, which will try to respond in the style of the chosen character.
